# SpaceSaga

Space Saga is my year 11 digital technology semester 1 project.
The optimal way to access this is through the link [Space Saga](https://space-saga.herokuapp.com/) - I am using a free MongoDB cluster, so it takes a while to load pages.
The rest of the submission is on OneNote.

Although most of my submitted answers deal with the game, the project has been reduced in scope to be the lobby only.

If deploying from the repository, the npm scripts are:
`npm run start`
This starts the repository normally, on port 3000.
However, if you wish to modify the code, you can do that with `npm run devStart`.

For ease of marking and navigation, I have left in the dev navigation bar at the top - however, the clock is intended to remain in the final product, to convey understanding of dynamic data.


NOTE: The passwords are left in so that you can access all of the games you make without needing to remember 10 of them - in the final product, that column of the table shall be deleted.
